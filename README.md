## Draw It or Lose It 
“Draw It or Lose It” is a popular android game by the Game Room based on the 1980s television game, Win, Lose or Draw. The team behind the app would like to expand the success of the game by developing a web-based game of the same app. This web-based version will serve multiple platforms such as Windows, Mac, Linux and Mobile Devices. The game will have the ability to pull in one or more teams with unique players assigned to the respective teams. Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check if the name is already in use. Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any time. Staff at the game room is looking to set up the development environments and are reaching out to CTS to facilitate the streamlined development. 



### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room Client is facilitating the development of the web-based version of game that loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I provided my evaluation of each operating platforms with its advantages and disadvantages. Then in conclusion I was able to make a recommendation that suits the clients needs.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document provided a clear roadmap for the development process, making it easier to understand the project requirements and goals. The document was a valuable communication tool for me as a developer. The document had details such as the functionality of the application, user interface requirements, and any technical specifications that needed to be followed.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like have client feedback section in the document itself. This would give me better idea of what the client's perspective is can clear up some unspoken things. 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I made sure to tackle every requirement that client requested. I eliminated potential bugs and issues. The program was user friendly. Using the Executive summary and the requirements as a guide I was able to ensure that the clients goals were met effectively.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
When determining how functions would need to flow, I used the UML diagram. I was able to include the client's objectives into the client-server template using a template as a guide, ensuring that the criteria were satisfied with little to no interference. The client was clear in their requirements which was helpful in designing the software. I would use the UML and design document in the future to batter analyze and design a similar software.
